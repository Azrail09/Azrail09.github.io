				<h4><strong>Differences between Media Literacy, Information Literacy, and Technology Literacy?</strong></h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Media Literacy</strong>
						<p>– is an umbrella term encompassing a variety of approaches that develop critical thinking skills around all types of media, build an understanding of how media messages shape our culture and society and give people tools to advocate for a change media system. Media Literacy also offers a solution to public health issues, such as body image issues and substance use, exacerbated by toxic media messages.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Information Literacy</strong>
						<p> – is the ability to find, evaluate, organize, use, and communicate information in all its various formats, most notably in situations requiring decision making, problem solving, or the acquisition of knowledge. It is essential for academic success, effective functioning in the workplace, and participation in society.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Technology Literacy</strong>
						<p> – is a term used to describe an individual’s ability to assess, acquire and communicate information in a fully digital environment. People who possess technology literacy are able to easily utilize a variety of digital devices such as computers, smartphones and tablets and interfaces such as e-mail, internet, social media, and cloud computing to communicate.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h4><strong>How does Media, Information, and Technology affect society?</strong></h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>It affects the society as everything that we need, do and learn are related to the three literacy. Media Literacy let us know where a certain news comes from or where it is coming from and offers different solutions to issues we are having difficulties with and more. While Information Literacy is a combination of research skills, critical thinking skills, computer technology skills, and communication skills that can help us develop and execute an effective research strategy using a wide range of search tools that is ethically, legally and easy to access to be able to evaluate the relevance, the quality, and credibility of information gathered.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h4><strong>What is Media? How do you view media?</strong></h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>“This is a term which covers all the means of communication which have functions such as informing, raising awareness, education, socialization, entertainment, and agenda setting, including all kinds of oral, written and visual images.” (IGI Global, n.d.). In other terms, media is everything you can do online, such as television, internet and so on. There are three (3) types of media according to Market Business News. First is Print Media, it includes all types of publications, including newspaper, journals, magazines, books and reports. Second is the Broadcast Media, it refers to radio and TV, however, experts predict that it will not be long before online sources take over. Third is the Internet, specifically websites and blogs. For me, media is something that everyone uses to gain knowledge, to see the news and anything they need to improve their daily needs.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h4><strong>Do media technologies have the power to transform cultures? Why/why not and how?</strong></h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>Yes, “Technology is changing every aspect of our lives. The benefits provided by new digital approaches are having a huge impact on our societies. However, one of the greatest business challenges is not about the devices, software or solutions – it is about how we manage the process of cultural change.” (Business Service, n.d.). Basically, due to media technologies, life became easier for us to do our daily lives and it will improve further as time passes by because of the future inventions that will be made.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h4><strong>How do I find information that matches my needs?</strong></h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>Most of the information that we need to know for our daily lives can mostly be found online, and since we became dependent to everything we see online, we tend to forget that some are not true. To be able to make sure that it is 99% legitimate and reliable sources, make sure the site you looked into is true by checking other sources and compare them with one another. Most legitimate and reliable sources are dictionaries, encyclopedias, newspaper, magazines, and books.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h4><strong>How do I choose from the wide variety of information made available by different sources?</strong></h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>The key to be able to choose from the wide variety of information is to check each sources and pick the best from all of them, and also make sure that your source is reliable and not fake, as there are a lot of fake news spreading and most people use that fake source due to not being able to check the reliability properly.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h4><strong>How does Manipulative Information and Multimedia affect You as a student?</strong></h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>As a student, manipulative information and media affects me in different ways, both positively and negatively. Such as in my learning, making friends online, and sharing my opinion on an issue publicly. In my learning, it helps me positively as I use manipulative information and media to help me with my studies. For example, if I were to have difficulties regarding to the subject discussed to me in my math class, I can just search for more information regarding to that topic to be able to understand it much better. However, due to social medias, it negatively affects my studies as I get distracted by it. Furthermore, media can be used to voice out my opinions on topics such as the election 2022. </p>
						<p>The multimedia information is very relevant to my generation and to the future generations. Not only because it helped us a lot in terms of living, but it is also used as a new form of education. That is why my generation is very lucky to be born in this modern time. In addition to that, if the multimedia information were to continue to improve, it will help the future generations greatly.</p>
						<p>Furthermore, we must always keep in mind that not all information that we read are true. That is why we must always check validity of the information we received and make sure that what we receive are true and not bias. </p>
